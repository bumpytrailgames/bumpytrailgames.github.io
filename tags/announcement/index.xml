I just wanted to announce the game I&amp;rsquo;m working on. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;strong>Without Escape&lt;/strong> and it is a point and click horror graphic adventure. It is inspired by those first person graphic adventures with pre-rendered backgrounds from the 90s.</description></item></channel></rss>
